'testapiapp' shoud be opened with visual studio code and use android emulator.

'flutter_db_test' should go in your www folder for ampps. Default 'root' and 'mysql' were used if you need that.

'flutter_test.sql' should be able to be imported to your phpMyAdmin.

Should run after that.

Pretty basic stuff but it is all connected.
